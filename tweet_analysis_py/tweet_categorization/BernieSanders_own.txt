What I’ve been saying loudly and clearly is: We’ve gotta invest in more jobs and education, not jails and incarceration.
Here’s a radical idea: Were going to create an economy that works for working families, not just the billionaires!

The greed of the pharmaceutical industry is killing Americans. That cannot continue.
Its immoral and unjust to leave tens of millions of Americans without health care. Any health care plan must address that issue.

This campaign is based upon a very simple principle: Real change never comes from the top on down. It always comes from the bottom up.
The pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people. We pay the highest prices for prescription drugs.
Since I have been an elected official, I have used my influence to stand with those who have no power. Thats what I do.
The problems facing this country now are so serious, are so deep, that the same-old, same-old establishment politics aint going to do it.
We need to take bold steps to stop the increased impoverishment of already depressed communities. We need to raise the minimum wage.
We win when people come together. We win when we reject division.
