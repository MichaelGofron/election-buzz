CLUSTERING

- Select some topics (10)
- Create bag of words
- Create feature vectors for each of the training tweets
FOR EACH TOPIC:
- Figure out the centroid of the feature vectors for each topic
- STORE THIS

Store: Bag of words
Store: For each topic, the centroids of each topic
----------------------------

LISTEN TO TWEETS
	- NEW TWEET:
		Tokenize it, filter out words
		Use k-nearest neighbor to figure out the closest topic
			(for each topic, calculate distance to that topic)

		For each distance:
			If the distance to a topic is greater than some threshold
			Then add tag (topic) to the tags of the tweet

		Store tweet as:
			username_id
			id
			tweet
			text
			tags

		Store username
			(as was done before) -- in theory, don't need to do this since we are listening on a select group of followers exclusively

		Store tag information
		!!! this could just be firebase!!!

			+1 for total tweets by that user
			+1 for total tweets related to a candidate
			for each tag:
				+1 for each candidate's count related to that tweet specifically


-----------------------------
