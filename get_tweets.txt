Get tweets:
I already have a database of 5 million tweets (+/-) but no username!


Get Tweets
	1. Listen on the mentions of users 'realTrump', 'tedcruz', 'etc' (all 5 candidates)
	2. Then collect data from each 
		1 request per minute -> max 1.440/day
		so would need to split it evenly
		better:
			2 - we can track 5000 users (1k for each candidate)


FIGURE OUT LIST OF USERS TO TRACK
	1. track nonstop tweets for a few days (5)
	2. record the user id of the people tweeting
	3. record also the username of the person tweeting (basically build a db of all usernames that we get)
	4. build a db of every person's tweets (identify by db)

FILTERING
	- filter out news
	- filter out @<supportive-message>
	- filter out people who have no followers (not influential enough)



------------------------
GET NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN FOLLOWERS IDS WHERE WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE TWEET FROM
select count(*) from users join followings on users.user_id=followings.follower_id
SPLIT BY CANDIDATE
select count(*) from users join followings on users.user_id=followings.follower_id group by followings.followed_id
