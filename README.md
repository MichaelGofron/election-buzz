  What it does - Election Buzz’s purpose is to provide insight into the presidential candidates and their followers on Twitter. This tool is helpful in that during election season the amount of tweets being generated by and about candidates is too many to keep up with. This project can be used by voters, journalists, campaign managers, etc to get an idea of what candidates are talking about. By making use of Twitter, we will collect information, buzzwords, hashtags, etc. from each candidate and will display the results in a clear way. 
  As a group, we also discussed different directions that we can take this project. We could highlight and filter out results by candidate, geography, time, and particular topics. In addition, we can possibly show if the reaction to a certain topic was mostly positive or negative. We can possibly also make a, “Who is xxxx according to Twitter,” page which generates a profile of each candidate based on their tweets and those of their followers. And finally, we discussed creating a graph showing how much candidates mention each other.
